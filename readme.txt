1. main_coexpression.m: main script to run the algorithm for co-expression network.
2. main_functionalLinkage.m: main script to run the algorithm for functional linkage network.
3. NetCox: Net-Cox function.
4. getS: calculate the co-expression network.
5. Normal_M: normalized the data by dividing square root of column sum and row sum.
